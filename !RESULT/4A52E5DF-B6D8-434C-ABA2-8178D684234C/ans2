The primary responsibility of a travel agent is to make the process of travel planning easier for the client and ensure they experience the best trip possible. Travel agents work directly with the public and converse with clients in order to determine the best possible travel destinations, transportation arrangements, and accommodations for the client`s particular needs. They may make suggestions to the client based on their experience, or offer complete travel packages from various resorts or cruise lines. They are often restricted to a budget, and must be highly organized in order to offer their clients travel arrangement that suit both their financial limitations and leisure or business travel expectations.
Agents work with computers or call airlines, cruise lines, resorts, and rental companies in order to secure travel arragements for their customers. They research information on their client`s travel plans and relay important information including weather conditions, travel advisories and required documents for their destination. Safety is also a factor international travel, so travel agents keep abreast of the latest news, ensuring that each planned destination is safe for their customers.
Travel agents work year-round, but are especially busy during peak vacation times in the summer and during holidays. During those times, agents are busy on the telephone planning trips and making last-minute itinerary charges for current customers. They also sell vacation packages from cruise lines, resorts and other destinations. During the off season, travel agents are busy reseaching destinations and learning about the latest offerings of prime travel resorts and locations. They will also uncover new destinations and find the best trips for a particular travel purpose, whether it be business-related for personal leisure.
