There are different kinds of recreation. Every person has his own ideas about the way he likes to relax and restore the energy after a long week of work. You might prefer leisure actibities or a passive rest.
People who prefer active rest usually like to go outside. They can enjoy beautiful nature and even go camping, skiing or snowboarding or just play games outside.
Another quite interesting kind of active recreation is excursions. Truth be known there is nothing more exciting than travelling the world and sightseeing, taste different cuisines and feel new cultures.
Beach vacation is a great choice for those who value peace and quite but at the same time like sports. You can enjoy sunbathing all day long and then later on you can play volleyball with your friends or swim in the sea.
Sometimes you get so tired at college or at work and you can`t even think about active recreation. You just want to sleep a lot  on the weekends, watch a movie or read a book. Your friends are not so important in this case. You start to value your solution.
I think everyone understands what I`m talking about. There`s nothing bad about spending a day alone, It`s a natural desire. And after some time we will have enough energy for other people and for the work.
